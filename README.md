# Welcome to the Request Network Project

## Project Overview

The Request Network project is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between data purchasers and validators on the Request Network, a decentralized data marketplace. This platform connects data purchasers with data providers (validators) to ensure a seamless and secure transfer of information.

### Key Components

- **Taoshi UI**: This user interface allows data purchasers to browse and register with validators. Validators use this UI to register their services.
- **Request Network Server**: This server acts as a mediator that relays requests between data purchasers and validators, ensuring decentralization and avoiding single points of failure.
- **Validator Node**: Operated by validators, this server setup provides data to purchasers via API endpoints.

Data purchasers register through the Taoshi UI and can access data from their chosen validators based on their subscription plan. Validators register their services through the Taoshi UI and set up their Validator Node to serve data to purchasers.

## User Guides

This project caters to three main user groups, each with dedicated guides to help you get started:

- **[Data Purchasers](DATA_PURCHASER.md)**: If you're interested in purchasing data, refer to the Data Purchaser Guide for instructions on how to register and access data.
- **[Validators](VALIDATOR.md)**: Validators looking to sell data on the Request Network should check out the Validator Setup Instructions for a comprehensive guide on setting up and maintaining a Validator node.
- **[Contributors/Developers](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Developers interested in contributing to the project can find local development setup and contribution guidelines in the Developer Guide.

## Getting Started

For more detailed information and to begin your interaction with the Request Network, please refer to the respective user guides linked above. Whether you're a data purchaser, a validator, or a developer, these guides will provide the necessary steps to engage with the platform effectively.
